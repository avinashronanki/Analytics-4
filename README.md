## Steps to deploy DeepRacer 
1. Sign into the console
2. Click the Get Started / Create Model button on the right
3. Create resources, if they aren't created yet
4. Name and describe your model
5. Choose an environment 
Where the training occurs; in our case, a simulated track.
6. Select action space
This lists out all of what the agent can actually do at each timestep.
7. Select reward function
An agent receives something from this in order to learn the appropriate actions to take.
8. Tune hyperparameters
Includes specific settings for our training, such as batch size, epochs or learning rate.
9. Set stop condition
This causes training to cease, whether it's time-based, an action, or other options.
10. Evaluation 

* Note: While the evaluation job is running, watch the live results in the simulator. Remember to look at what your car seems to be doing well versus not so well.
